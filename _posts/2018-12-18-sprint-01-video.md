This video highlights some of our added functionality to the simulator. You can now use Apollo's Navigation Mode, which uses only low-cost sensors like radar and camera. In navigation mode, the vehicle can follow a navigation as well as detect obstacles and lane lines.

Additionally, you will be able configure weather, time of day, and road wetness conditions, allowing you to test your autonomous stack in parameterizable environment conditions.

Finally, we have added initial pedestrian support inside our environments. You can now test obstacle detection (camera, LiDAR) with pedestrian traffic in the environment.
