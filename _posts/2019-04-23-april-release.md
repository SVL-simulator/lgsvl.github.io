The LGSVL Simulator 2019.04 release is now available for
<a data-category="outbound" data-action="blog-20190423" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases/2019.04">download</a> on our Github. The April release features full Cyber RT support for Apollo 3.5 and a new Apollo 3.5 vehicle.

Additionally, we are proud to introduce our Python API for the simulator. You can now control all aspects of simulation with a script, including creating and running scenarios, starting/stopping simulation, collecting sensor data, controlling the environment, and controlling all ego and non-ego agents. You can see the API documentation <a data-category="outbound" data-action="blog-20190423" target="_blank" href="https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/docs/python-api/">here</a>.

We also have a new map, the Taiwan CAR Lab, a test facility for autonomous vehicles in Tainan, Taiwan that is available in the simulator. This map accurately reflects the real world test facility - you can check out a <a data-category="outbound" data-action="blog-20190423" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/zUOCYvHTa2E">video</a> of the project put together by our users at National Cheng Kung University!

There are many more improvements and bug fixes since the last release. You can check our <a data-category="outbound" data-action="blog-20190423" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases/tag/2019.04">release notes</a> for the full list of updates since the last release.
